# TESTING

## HTML VERIFIER

Using w3c HTML verifier I checked all live pages deployed on heroku. There were several warnings and some errors involving stray div's and li elements. These have been removed by making use of the authenticator.
The major warning given was that the javascript at the bottom of the page doesnt require text="text/javascript". These aren't serious warnings however have been removed.
